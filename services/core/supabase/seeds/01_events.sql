A month-long celebration dedicated to the improvement and growth of open source technology. Throughout the month of October, we extend a warm invitation to all open-source software enthusiasts, whether beginners or seasoned developers, to join us in contributing to open-source projects. This annual event plays a crucial role in fostering the growth of open source projects, enabling developers to become valuable contributors or maintainers, and bringing together vibrant developer communities not just in Cebu but both online and offline, globally.

Aside from encouraging people to contribute to existing Open Source Projects, we will also be holding a month long hackathon which will run from October 5 to 27, 2024. Teams of up to 4 individuals will be given 21 days to create a new Open Source Project. At the end of the hackathon, Awards will be given out to the Participating Teams for different categories, and winning participants will get swag kits and exclusive partner prizes. We will
also award the best Open Source Contribution that was submitted during the event.

This event is spearheaded by Javascript Cebu and PizzaPy Cebu Python Users Group, with the support of various Cebu Tech Communities - React Cebu, Laravel Cebu, Cebu Game Dev, DevCon Cebu, GDG Cebu, Cebu WordPress Meetup, CebuXD, Web3 Cebu, and AI Gen Cebu.

We thank our sponsors and partners  - LegalMatch Philippines, The Graph Philippines, enspace, and The Sandbox Foundation (& others to be announced) of the said event as well as well as our awesome speakers (to be announced) and volunteers who will make this truly one of its kind.
