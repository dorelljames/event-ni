About Hacktoberfest:
Hacktoberfest — brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with Dev & Intel — is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they''ve just discovered. No contribution is too small — bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.

Participating Communities include Angular Cebu, AWS User Group Central Visayas, Cebu Game Dev, Cebu WordPress Meetup, Facebook Developers Circle Cebu City, Google Developers Group Cebu, JavaScript Cebu, Laravel Cebu, PizzaPy Python Users Group Cebu, React Cebu, Vue Cebu among others.', '2020-10-01 12:00:00+00', '2020-10-31 07:00:00+00', '2024-10-06 06:52:35.343696+00', 'Online', 805640610189326, NULL, NULL, 'https://scontent.fceb1-5.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/122894544_1077722549328216_3079637410051887122_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=9e60e4&_nc_eui2=AeHtD3B0d_3VsImSmhIdB3QdcCaK6nkB5wtwJorqeQHnC630GRXbVJOM4UIp1M90xXo&_nc_ohc=j6jgB6GNvf4Q7kNvgETduIk&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent.fceb1-5.fna&edm=ABTKTjYEAAAA&_nc_gid=AIEv-87PSYRC8b2Mw-18mVR&oh=00_AYCMdszpen1uuZHRTad2nYe5pdFklFFerTEIg61UP2g8Hw&oe=6737CBBE', false, NULL, false, NULL, 'cebu-hacktoberfest-2020-805640610189326');

Laravel is an open-source PHP framework. Laravel reuses the existing components of different frameworks which helps in creating a web application. The web application thus designed is more structured and pragmatic.
Laravel offers a rich set of functionalities which incorporates the basic features of PHP frameworks like CodeIgniter, Yii and other programming languages like Ruby on Rails. Laravel has a very rich set of features which will boost the speed of web development.

Advantages of Laravel
Laravel offers you the following advantages, when you are designing a web application based on it −
1. The web application becomes more scalable, owing to the Laravel framework.
2. Considerable time is saved in designing the web application, since Laravel reuses the components from other framework in developing web application.
3. It includes namespaces and interfaces, thus helps to organize and manage resources.

DevCon Cebu together Laravel Cebu will hold an exclusive codecamp for USC students with the course outline below:
- Introduction to Laravel

We''ll guide you through setting up Strapi, taming Next.js, and unleashing your creativity.

- Functional and Class Component

- Conditional Rendering
- List & Conditionals
- Lifecycle Methods
- Immutability
- Routing
- HTTP

Some things we would like to highlight for the Session 1:
-We will be collecting 100php as door fee for the snacks, and we require you to bring your own laptop.
-Session starts at 1PM, doors open for Registration at 12NN. Please come on time, as we want to maximize the duration of the workshop and discuss as many topics as we can.
-Workshop participants should have NodeJS version 8+ installed in their laptops, and should have a text editor (VSCode, Sublime, Atom, etc.)

We''ve sent confirmation messages to those who signup from bit.ly/react-cebu-series. Please confirm ASAP as slots are limited to 40 only. Confirmed participants MUST attend the said workshop at the indicated time and venue. Failure to do so would entail sanctions and would prevent the participant from joining future ReactJS Cebu events.
