        Cebby was created with a simple but powerful mission: to connect Cebu's
        vibrant tech and event communities on a single platform. By aggregating
        events from across the region, we aim to bridge the gap between
        organizers, communities, and audiences, making it easier for everyone to
        find and participate in events that matter to them.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Cebby is an open-source platform that brings together event information
        from a variety of sources â€” Facebook, Meetup, Eventbrite, and more â€” so
        that you can discover what's happening around Cebu in one convenient
        place. For organizers and community leaders, Cebby provides powerful
        tools to reach a wider audience, manage events across platforms, and
        gain insights into event performance.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Our open-source foundation reflects our commitment to transparency,
        accessibility, and community ownership. We believe in creating
        technology that's shaped by and for the people who use it. By making
        Cebby open-source, we invite developers and contributors from around the
        world to improve, extend, and enhance the platform. This approach
        ensures Cebby remains flexible, innovative, and community-centered.
